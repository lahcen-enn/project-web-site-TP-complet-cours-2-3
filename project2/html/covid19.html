    <p>It was found that a new <mark>virus</mark> called SARS-CoV-2 was the cause of an outbreak of a disease that began to appear in China in 2019. The resulting disease is called: Corona virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19).
       In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared <strong>COVID-19</strong> a global pandemic. Public health groups, including the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization, are monitoring the pandemic and posting updates on their websites. These groups issue recommendations to prevent the spread of this virus that causes Covid 19 disease</p>

    <p>The novel coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine can prevent you from getting sick with COVID-19 or getting severely ill or dying from COVID-19. But what is the mechanism of action of different types of Covid-19 vaccines?
       Each <b>COVID-19 </b>vaccine causes the immune system to make antibodies to fight COVID-19. COVID-19 vaccines use a harmless version of the spike structure on the surface of the COVID-19 virus called an S protein.</p>
       <ul type="square">
        <li>Messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccine. This type of vaccine uses genetically engineered mRNA to instruct cells on how to produce the S protein on the surface of the COVID-19 virus. After receiving the vaccine, muscle cells begin to produce pieces of S protein that are then distributed to the surface of the cells. This causes your body to make antibodies. If you later contract COVID-19, these antibodies will fight the virus.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Viral vector vaccine. In this type of vaccine, scientists take genetic material from the COVID-19 virus and insert it into a modified version of another virus (called a viral vector). When the viral vector enters cells, it delivers genetic material containing the COVID-19 virus that instructs your cells to make copies of the S protein. Once the S proteins appear on the surfaces of your cells, your immune system responds by creating antibodies and defensive white blood cells. If you later contract COVID-19, the antibodies will fight the virus.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Vaccine protein subunits. Subunit vaccines include only the parts of the virus that best stimulate your immune system. This type of Covid-19 vaccine contains harmless S proteins. Once your immune system identifies the S proteins, it creates antibodies and defensive white blood cells. If you later contract COVID-19, the antibodies will fight the virus.</li>
    </ul>
